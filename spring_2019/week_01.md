## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This week, I learned how to use markdown for the sidebar of our project that explains to the students who will
> be using the program what they will need to do. I also started to relearn Python, as well as begin to develop an 
> example project path in the curriculum for the card game, War.

## This Week's Plan

> For the upcoming week, I plan to finish the implementation of the project path I have started, look into creating
> other paths, and figure out how to help organize the repository.

## Anything Blocking?

> The only blocker I currently have is that of relearning Python, which can be easily fixed the more I work with
> it by putting in the time and effort.
