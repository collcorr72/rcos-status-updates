## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This week, I finished writing play_game(), and believe I have fixed the bugs I encountered in turn() while running play_game(). I
> may add some more tests to ensure that it fully works.

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I plan to finish the markdown files associated the the steps in the path.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing blocking, unless extra test cases reveal a new problem.
