## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This week, I finished converting my war function into a turn function, which plays a card from each hand, and returns the winner,
> running through the war part of this function when necessary.

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I plan to work on the a function to print ASCII art of the cards in play, as well as create a function that calls the
> turn function repeatedly until the end of the game is reached.

## Anything Blocking?

> A little stuck on how I want to do the ASCII art, but will figure it out through trial and error when I put more work in.
