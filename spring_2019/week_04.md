## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This week, I created the war function, which turned out to be much longer than I had planned, and also uses recursion. I also
> went through and made sure that the branch had the functions pushed that I had finished in the previous weeks, and that each
> step had a markdown file for the sidebar to go with it. I ran into some problems merging, but was able to find help to figure
> out how to fix those problems.

## This Week's Plan

> Over break, I will try to look at why my war function isn't returning the correct answer, and also try to rewrite it so that
> it works iteratively, instead of recursively. I might also look for a way to implement the turn function.

## Anything Blocking?

> Right now, my war function should work, but instead it returns nothing.  I have used a debugger and followed how the function
> behaves, and have traced it to the return line, but for some reason it reads the line, skips over it, and continues the function.
