## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This week, I have finished up changes to the "compare" function, as well as the the helper "switch" function that uses a 
> dictionary to assign a number to a card so that you can compare cards, but may have to go back and decide that that function
> would have to be a branching spot if used in other paths.

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I plan to finish the "war" function, as well as start the "turn" function, as well as create the markdown
> files for last week's and this week's functions.

## Anything Blocking?

> Currently, the way I have set up the "war" function is recursive, which at this stage, would be too difficult for
> students to be expected to figure out if they follow this path, as it will be categorized as a basic path. I plan 
> on using it as a placeholder function for this week, but will go back and change it to an iterative solution when 
> I am able.
