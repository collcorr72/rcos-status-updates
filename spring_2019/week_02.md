## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This week, I continued pathing out a possible project for the curriculum that students would be able to use.  I've
> coded more for this project, the card game War, as well as thought out how this project could relate to other projects
> that the students may want to complete, so that students can code parts at a time, and decide which path they want to take,
> which eventually leads to the completion of a project that will be a full card game.

## This Week's Plan

> For the upcoming week, I plan to completely finish the current project, and look into breaking up parts so that other
> projects could use pieces of code that the students will create, thus allowing more of a "choose your own path."

## Anything Blocking?

> Currently, we are problem solving on what would be the best way to handle a case where war, or multiple wars happen,
> and how we can make it clear enough that students completing this project would be able to understand how to code
> it for themselves.
