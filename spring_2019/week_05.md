## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This week, I figured out why my war function wasn't returning the correct answer, so now the function works recursively, which
> we decided was fine for the current path that we are finishing.

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I plan on figuring out how to create a function that merges the war function and a new turn function. Doing this
> may mean I have to rewrite the war function, perhaps something iterative. Hopefully by the end of this week, this current game
> path will be finished, and then next week we can work on cleaning everything up.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing blocking at the moment.
