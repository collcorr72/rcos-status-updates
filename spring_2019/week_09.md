## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This week, I fixed turn(), as well as went through and made a lot of minor changes in each of the files in an attempt to clean up
> little formatting issues, among other things, like changing the old war() to turn(). I also created skeletal markdown documents 
> for each of the steps.

## This Week's Plan

> This upcoming week, I plan to discuss the style and what each markdown file should contain, so that we can maintain a structure.
> If we decide this project is fully completed, I might even start thinking about how to implement another path, using some of the
> same code we already created.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing blocking.
